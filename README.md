The repository contains various documents related to the master's thesis. 

The primary objective during the thesis work is to master the usage of k8s operators and CRDs. As such, this repository will primarily focus on these topics (as of now).

This README serves as a brief description of each file included.

## [learning-path](learning-path.md)

This is the starting point for anyone wishing to follow the steps I have taken. 

The document outlines the learning path for Kubernetes Operators development.

## [minikube-dev-env](minikube-dev-env.md)

Setting up a development environment is a key part of the learning path. This document presents my approach to this task.

## [Virtual Networking Directory](Virtual Networking/Virtual Networking.md)

This contains a tutorial on the network adapter modes available in Oracle VM VirtualBox. These modes are mentioned elsewhere in this repository, hence the inclusion of this guide.

## [crd-playground-lab](crd-playground-lab.md)

Simple lab to play with [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).

## [notes](notes.md)

Here are some notes that I found important. They might be useful to others as well.

## [cloopdemo1](https://github.com/0x41gawor/cloopdemo1)
Private repo.
