The first thing that we need is a Business Case. 

Need to come up with some simple subject that can be monitored and adjusted by the control loop. It doesn't have to be 100% real, but something that:

- lots of engineers would easily understand
- is memorable 

The business case is presented in [business-case.md](business-case.md).
